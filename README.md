# Raspberry Pi Laser Gimbal
This project would have originally been a public art display, but instead I made it with a Raspberry Pi and some servo motors in my front yard.
The python file is the motion tracking source code based on [PyImageSearch's OpenCV Tutorial](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/)
